# TrafficLightsSim
Designed and developed a graphical user interface (GUI) application to simulate a traffic light system using Python and Tkinter. 
The application allows users to interact with the traffic lights by selecting different light states (red, yellow, green) through radio buttons.

Key Features:

Interactive Interface: Users can control the state of the traffic lights through an intuitive interface with radio buttons for each color.
Dynamic State Changes: When a color is selected, the corresponding light changes, and the others are reset to "off," simulating the transition between different traffic light states.
Visual Representation: A canvas is used to draw the traffic light system, with circles representing red, yellow, and green lights.
Modular Design: The program utilizes functions to handle light state changes and to ensure that only one light is illuminated at a time.
